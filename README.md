# design-system-to-chakra

It is a simple project that served to explore deeply some of the many resources that [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com) provides to stylize components already in the creation of the theme. Developed for study purposes only.

Based on a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)'s design system project called [Pixelmatters Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/fMbEylk8ZVkLJ69CQKkyqj/Design-System-Template-(Community).

The main resources explored were:

- Light/Dark Mode for any component (Chakra or not)
- How to style a Chakra component with your theme object (Without needing to declare anything in the component's Props).
- How to style a third-party component. We tested these two: [React-Select](https://react-select.com/home) and [React-Multi-Date-Picker](https://shahabyazdi.github.io/react-multi-date-picker/).

### To run the project on your machine

1. clone this project
2. install the dependencies
3. execute `yarn dev`

Note: Light/Dark mode has only been applied to some components. There was no reference in the Figma project and the goal was just to find ways to make.
